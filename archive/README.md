# PORTFOLIO

Look at all the cool stuff I've done.

Built with Webpack 4 and Vue.js

See it live in action on the internet at [Blake Netzeband . com](https://www.blakenetzeband.com)

## Notes to future self and anyone who reads this:

- Uses Hot Module Loading
- Split all .css files from .vue file. Split .js files when sensible (i.e. projects.vue)
- Everything in assets/images/ are directly copied to dist/
- CSS in assets/stylesheets uses vue-style-loader
- global included in App.vue
- Shape of data object is defined on top of data file
- Name of data files is _componentName_-_subComponentName_.js
- yarn commands:

```
$ yarn run dev
$ yarn run build
```

## Stuff I could do better...

- Codespliting - main.js is too big
- Shrink png files even more? idk look into this because they're already compressed
