# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The Dweb: Using Beaker + Dat to Surf and Publish on the Decentralized Web!

The Internet is beautiful dumpster fire. One of the more profound inventions of
our time, it was designed to liberate and empower the billions of people on
earth by making information readily available. Yet somewhere along the way, the
power has shifted and information is now being funneled through a select few
players before it reaches you and me. The consequences of this design change has
created a negative rippled effect in almost all factors of human life, to the
extent that even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,
[has spoke out against this trend](https://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/).
The decentralized web is predicted to be our saving grace. This article is aimed
to teach you<sup>\*</sup> how to get your foot in the door and surf the next
generation of the Internet.

```note
Though at some point we might dive into the weeds and get into some technical concepts, this article is intended for everyone‚Ä¶ just like the original Internet üòâ
```

## First, Some History

The Internet was built on the concept of decentralization. Information would be
distributed through a fault-tolerant network of independently-run nodes. If one
node went down or become insecure, the information could be re-routed through a
series of neighboring nodes to reach it's final destination. This much has
remained true to today.

When people bellyache that the Internet has become centralized, they're either
referring to the fact that the ownership of these nodes has been funneled to a
few major players(i.e. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) or the exclusive access
to these nodes has been limited to a few dominant companies (i.e. your Internet
Service Provider: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.).

This concentration of power has opened the doors to
[massive censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall), the
[widespread](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/3/13/un-facebook-had-a-role-in-rohingya-genocide)
[dissemination](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-philippines-dutertes-drug-war)
of [‚ÄúFake News‚Äù](https://www.npr.org/tags/502124007/fake-news), and the
unwinding of the
[network's neutrality](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/18073512/network-neutrality)<sup>\*</sup>.
As for-profit companies strengthen their grip on the Internet, ours will weaken.

```note
If you choose one topic to dive further into, pick net neutrality. In a nut shell, a non-neutral Internet allows ISPs to prioritize traffic, which means the website of a higher paying customer (i.e a wealthy corporation) would load exponentially faster. Considering most users will abandon a page if it doesn't load within a 4-second window, this could be detrimental for companies and individuals who can't afford to **bribe** the ISPs for a faster loading time. I will point out that we're still in the early days of a post-neutral net, so many of these dystopic predictions are still years away.
```

## Decentralize It

It wouldn't be an tech article without some TLAs (three-letter acronyms), so
here we go: P2P!

Peer-to-peer is networking strategy that partitions workloads and resources to a
vast network of peers. Our current distribution strategy is structured around
client-server interactions via spoke-hub model. I (the client) request
information from a website (the server), which returns a packet of information
that travels through a series of spoke and hubs (we previously referred to these
as nodes).

![Hub-and-spoke network of the United States](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*hNN5weGjR-1CU_eU5PWtjA.jpeg)

A P2P paradigm fractures the client-server interaction. Instead of a central
data warehouse holding all the files for a website, these files would be
fragmented and distributed across an assemblage of computers/phones/servers.
Those of us who have lived in the weird world of torrents will remember this
interaction: you can download a file from a constellation of peers, while
simultaneously ‚Äúseed‚Äù the file (i.e. make it available for others to download).

However, with all it's splendor, P2P networks still face some sizable privacy,
security, and social hurdles‚Ä¶

## Dat For The Win

[Dat](https://datproject.org/) is one of a few impressive solution in the P2P
space. Dat is a protocol that's sprinkled with a few sugary features to resolve
some of the issues surrounding the P2P architecture. It's designed for
file-sharing among research groups, but it's applicable to the Internet at
large. Let's dive into these issues and solutions:

### Integrity and Versioning

Integrity issues take 2 forms:

- **link rot:** websites will change their URL, so expired URLs lead users to
  404 ‚Äúuh-oh‚Äù pages.
- **content drift:** websites update the content of a page, but the URL doesn't
  reflect the changes.

  Dat resolves these issues by creating a
  [Merkle tree](https://brilliant.org/wiki/merkle-tree/) for every project. For
  the sake of brevity and readability, a Merkle tree is a complicated and secure
  data structure which encrypts and organizes a multitude of files. Merkle trees
  are common with versioning tools (such as Git and Subversion) and blockchain
  tech. Dat's Merkle trees contain 2 sections:

- **Metadata:** this is where information about the project lives, such as name,
  author, size, last modify date, etc.
- **Content:** this is where the project data/content lives. The data is
  splintered in an arrangement of easily-transferable packets, which are
  represented as leaves on the Merkle tree.

With this architecture in place, if I update my fabulous/mind-melting website
and a client doesn't take kindly to my changes, they could then request to see
the previous version of the site<sup>\*</sup>. Perhaps more importantly, every
distributed leaf uses a top hash to correlate itself to a tree; meaning, when a
project gets chunked into a series of packets, each packet links back to the
root of the project through some cryptographic wizardry.

```note
I'll admit that this process doesn't sound very user friendly, but remember that Dat is simply the protocol. At some point a browser would then take over all the heavy UI/UX lifting.
```

### Privacy and Security

We now have every web site split into a multitude of small packets and
distributed across the world via a network of peers. When I try to visit your
website via the Dat protocol, I will first look for peers that possess the data
for your website in a process called **Source Discovery**. Once I get a list of
peers, I'll establish a connection with them and begin downloading. This
symbiotic group of peers downloading and seeding data is called a **swarm**.
Because of Dat's end-to-end encryption, I'm assured that the data I'm receiving
isn't going to be intercepted or manipulated, and due to some nifty
cryptographic features of the Merkle tree, I'm ensured that the data I receive
is the data I'm expecting.

### Into the weeds

_(Feel free to skip this part if you're not technically inclined)_

There's 2 additional levels of customization that makes the Dat protocol even
more charming. The source discovery phases uses any combination of 3 networks,
with the ability to add networks if needed:

- **DNS:** The most prevalent network for naming and identifying Internet
  entities (websites, email servers, etc.). It's essentially the phone book of
  the Internet.
- **Multicast DNS:** A zero-config extension of DNS that useful for local
  networks.
- **Mainline DHT:** A Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table üò≥. Simply put, it's
  a decentralized network designed and used by BitTorrent to manage their peers.

Then, during the swarming phase, clients have an option to customize their
transportation layer: TCP, UTP, or HTTP (Dat's default protocol).

This article doesn't have the bandwidth to hash out the pros and cons of each
networks and protocol- what's important is that the Dat protocol is empowering
clients to tailor their discovery networks and communication protocols in order
to meet their privacy needs.

## Surf The Web

The quickest way to surf the Dweb is with the
[Beaker browser](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/blob/master/archive-notice.md).
Beaker is built on Chromium, so it feels and looks just like Chrome. The big
difference is, it supports the dat:// protocol. To download the beaker browser,
head on over to their installation page.

Once your on Beaker‚Ä¶ surf! You can visit any ol' centralized website (including
this one!), but the real magic is the dat:// sites

## Publish on the Dweb

Choose your own adventure! You have two options in contributing to the Dweb: the
command line way or the browser way. I'll walk you through both.

### Option 1: Cool Techy Command Line Way

```note
The following section is catered to mac users, the general workflow should be the same for non-mac users, but you'll have to amend the process here-and-there to get by
```

Already have a website you want to publish? Great! If not, just go to here,
right click, select ‚ÄúSave Page As‚Ä¶‚Äù, then name it index.html or something more
sexy if you'd like.

In your terminal, download Dat using npm (don't have npm? get it)<sup>1</sup>:

```console
npm install -g dat
```

Now plop your html file into a new directory and dat-ify it<sup>2</sup>:

```console
mkdir ~/Sites/dweb
mv ~/Downloads/Index.html ~/Sites/dweb
cd ~/Sites/dweb
dat share .
```

```note
1. If you're using a package manager and already have a project build out, feel free to download dat locally.

2. Again, if you have you're publishing a previously created site, then skip the first two lines and just run `dat share <path-to-directory>`
```

Cool! You've successfully contributed to the Dweb! But what the heck just
happened? Let's break it down.

#### The .dat directory

A newly created directory should pop up in your project's directory. If we dive
into it, we'll see a handful of binary files that start with either content or
metadata. Since you're an observant reader, you'll remember these two keywords
when we broke down the Merkle tree‚Ä¶ we've gone full circle!

If your some sort of wizard, you could re-code these files into human language
and inspect them further, but for now, be happy knowing that it's your website
converted into a fancy new Merkle tree. Neat!

#### Dat Statistics

The last 3 printed lines in your terminal are some general stats about your
site. As of now, your site has been published, but sadly, your dat doesn't have
an audience üòû‚Ä¶ yet! This can be read as:

> Sharing Dat: 1 files (x.x KB)
>
> 0 connections | Downloads 0 B/s Connections 0 B/s

#### Dat URL

In your terminal, you'll see a bizarre URL that's something like this:

> dat://\<64-character hex-encoded Ed25519 hash>

This is your address on the Dweb! Let's check it out: copy-and-paste it into the
Beaker browser.

#### Next Steps

Neato, it works! Now go back to your terminal and witness the updates. You
should see something like:

> 1 connection | Download 0 B/S Upload 0 B/S

Again: neato! Now let's make an update. Open up your html file (maybe located in

`~/Sites/dweb`) in some cool IDE, such as Sublime, WebStorm, etc or just a plan
ol' text-editor, such as TextEdit. Do something weird (I wrapped a section in
note blocks to give you a good starting point). Save it. Then back to the
terminal:

```console
dat sync
```

Wammy! That's about all she wrote. There's some more neat things, such as‚Ä¶

cloning someone else's (i.e. mine!) dat project:

```console
dat clone dat://dat-webgl.hashbase.io <path-to-directory>
```

Doctoring<sup>\*</sup> a bonked project:

```console
dat doctor
```

Getting a little help:

```console
dat status (shows information about the current dat project)
dat help (general information about the dat command line tool)
```

```note
dat doctor runs two tests:

1. Verifies peer connection via a public server.
2. Returns a link that allows you to test direct peer connections
```

### Option 2: The Beaker route

Fire up Beaker, click the hamburger, and then click Create New. Choose your own
adventure! From here, either select:

- **Website:** Creates a pretty boring ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù site for you, which
  includes your garden variety files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and
  `styles.css`. Plus some dat-specific files: `.datignore` and `dat.json`
- **Empty project:** Creates a project with only the `.datignore` and `dat.json`
  files. You add your own website assets.
- **From folder:** Imports an existing dat project and auto-magically sync it
  with your local directory.

_Red arrows point to some fun features: add files to a project, change sync
location, and add a favicon image_

## Stay Stoked

Give yourself a pat on the back; you've successful pushed the enveloped and
surfed/developed on the distributed web. Don't stop now though, ensure some
longevity to your site with some neat hosting options.
