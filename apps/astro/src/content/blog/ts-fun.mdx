# TS Fun

While I was building out my portfolio, I discovered a funny quirk with
[Typescript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).

## A Quick Primer

For the uninitiated, a generic is simply a component (function, class, variable,
etc) that spans `types`. You'll commonly see them in polymorphic functions. The
contrived example we'll be using is pulled directly from the TS docs:

```ts
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

I've always read this from left-to-right, which lead me to believe that `Type`
needs to be declared if `arg` is going to be casted correctly.

In my mind, there were 2 exceptions, which it turns out, are only partially
true. The exceptions were:

1. a constraint is declared with the `extends` keyword

```ts
function identityElement<Type extends HTMLElement>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

2. a default value is declared with the `=` operator:

```ts
function identityElement<Type = HTMLDivElement>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

## Enter "Type Argument Inference"

So there I was click-clacking along, when I absent-mindedly forgot to include an
argument to the generic and yet, the correct type was returned. This wild
phenomenon is known as `type argument interference`. Let me explain:

What's happening is TS is correctly inferring the type of the functional
argument, which it assigns to `Type`. So in reality, the following return the
same types

```ts
var a = identity<string>("");
var b = identity("");
```

## And More!

Even cooler is that it respects the type differences between `var`, `let` and
`const`. As you know, the `const` declarator means a variable _immutable_ and
therefore, its type is typically its value:

```ts
/**
 * This is of type `string` since it's mutable.
 * TS correctly infers it's a string and therefor any mutations will not change its type.
 */
var a = "hello";

/**
 * This, however, is of type `"goodbye` since it's immutable.
 */
const b = "goodbye";
```

This same inference is applied to generics:

```ts
/** The following are all type `"hello"` since they're immutable */

const a = identity("hello");
const hello = "hello!";
const results5 = identity(hello);

/** While these are all type `string` since they're mutable */

var goodby = "goodbye!";
const b = identity(goodby);
const goodbyeForGood = "GOODBYE!";
var c = identity(goodbyeForGood);
```
