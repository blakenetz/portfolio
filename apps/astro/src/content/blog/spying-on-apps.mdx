# 🕵️‍♀️ Spying on Apps: How to Sleuth Back

It shouldn't come as a surprise that data is gold, and tech and non-tech
companies alike are rushing to obtain it. Unfortunately for you and me, that
means our privacy, both digital and non, is being encroached upon. From
[app developers stealing digital candy from babies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html)
to the
[myriad of Facebook privacy violations](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=facebook+privacy&sort=byPopularity&prefix=&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story),
all of our activity on any smart device is being tracked, mapped, and then
cashed.

Like prior gold rushes, online privacy has become a very political and nuanced
issue; ergo, only a select few are fully aware of the scope and influence of
today's 49ers. The intent of this article is to empower you to pan the gold
flowing down the data steams of your computer, phone, thermostat, etc. using
[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/).

```note
My intent in writing this article is to appeal to anyone with any tech
experience. Whether you're 👨‍💻, 👩‍🎤, 👨‍🚀, or 🧛‍♀️, you should be able to follow this
tutorial.

...Ok I lied a bit- I'm only going to walk through how to set up mitmproxy with
the Apple tools I have: macOS and iOS.

## Part 1

### First, the Internet

Before we get our hands dirty, let's take a quick look at what we're working
with (feel free to skip ahead if your a know-it-all):

#### HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol defines how a client (i.e. your web browser/phone)
and server (i.e. Facebook, Yelp, Google, etc) should converse with one another.
It's structured around a request-response cycle. For example, we _request_ the
webpage www.google.com and Google _responds_ with a packet of files. There's a
few additional features involving caching and relaying requests, but that's out
of the scope of this article.

#### HTTPS

To prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks (more on this later), we
updated the security of HTTP by adding an encryption layer (SSL). With HTTPS,
the data is encrypted bidirectionally- meaning, both the client and server
encrypts their data. Before the client approves the response, it'll first verify
the server's identity by ensuring it has a certificated signed by a trusted CA
(Certificate Authority). There's a few more nuances here, but again, it's out of
the scope of this article.

#### mitmproxy

mitmproxy is a suite of tools used to intercept and modify the web traffic
described above. If we dissect the name, we see it's employing a
[man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
(i.e. MITM) via a [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)
(i.e. an intermediary between the client and server). For HTTP requests,
mitmproxy simply receives the requests, passes it along to the server, receives
that response, then passes it back to you (the client). For HTTPS requests,
mitmproxy acts as the CA. Now, before you go hacking the world, understand that
mitmproxy is an untrustworthy CA, so you (the client) have to deliberately trust
the mitmproxy cert before it can actualize a successful MITM attack.

### The Setup

Let's begin.

#### Install mitmproxy

```bash
brew install mitmproxy
```

Don't have Homebrew? [Install it here](https://brew.sh/) (don't worry- Homebrew
is trustworthy and a very cool way to install the things you need in life 😇)

#### Fire Up mitmproxy

```bash
mitmproxy --showhost
```

```note
For the non-techies: to quit mitmproxy, type q followed by y. To go back to the terminal while mitmproxy is running, type command + t to open a new tab.
```

#### Get The mitmproxy Certs

Copy the directory containing your mitmproxy certificates to your Downloads
folder with the following command:

```bash
cp -r ~/.mitmproxy ~/Downloads/mitm
```

#### Install Your certs

Open the mitm folder and double-click the `mitmproxy-ca.pem` file (this should
open up Keychain Access). Double-click the **mitmproxy** listing, and then
change the **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)** to **Always Trust**.

Alternatively, you can visit [http://mitm.it](http://mitm.it), click the Apple
symbol, and then follow their directions (we'll need access to the
**.mitmproxy** directory in the next step though). You also need to setup your
browsers before doing so (see next steps).

![Screenshots of an Apple Keychain interface installing the proxy](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*2T5d1lROmevvu4CxFpbXUA.jpeg)

#### Setup Your Browser

```note
Chrome and Safari will use your system's preferences. Firefox has it's own set of preferences. If you prefer Firefox, scroll down to the next section.
```

Go to **System Preferences** > **Network** > **Advanced…** > **Proxies**

From there select **HTTP** and **HTTPS**, and then input **127.0.0.1** as the
server name (left of the colon) and **8080** as the port (right of the colon).
Make sure you fill out the forms for both **HTTP** and **HTTPS**! Click **OK**
and then **Apply**.

#### Setup Your Browser (Firefox edition)

Go to Firefox's **preferences** (command + ,). Scroll to the **Network Proxy**
header and then click the **Settings…** button (alternatively, just search for
“proxy”). In the following screen, select **Manual proxy configuration** radio
button, and then input **127.0.0.1** as both the HTTP proxy and SSL proxy, with
**8080** as the port.

Return to the preferences screen, in the **Privacy & Security** section, scroll
to the **Security** header and under the **Certificates** sub-header, click the
**View Certificates…** button (alternatively, just search for “certificates”).
From there, click the **Import…** button and select the **mitmproxy-ca.pem**
file from the mitm directory (located in your Downloads folder). Click the
**OK** button when finished.

#### Setup Your Phone

```note
Feel free to skip this section if you only want to inspect the data streaming from your computer's browser.
```

Get your router's IP address from **System Preferences** > **Network** screen
(it should be listed under your WIFI's name).

![Screenshot of the Network settings](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*SpdMZjX44PajN4xzkAkV5g.jpeg)

Next, send the **mitmproxy-ca.pem** cert to your phone, either via email or
airdrop. Once received, simply click **Install** and your phone will do the
rest. In Apple's eyes, this cert looks a bit sketchy, so we may need to
advisedly trust it by going to **Settings** > **General** > **About** >
**Certificate Trust Setting** and enable **FULL TRUST FOR ROOT CERTICATES** for
**mitmproxy**.

On your phone, in the **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** screen, tap the blue **ⓘ** next
your network's name. Scroll down to **HTTP PROXY** and set **Configure Proxy**
to **Manual**. Input your IP address in the **Server** field and **8080** in the
port field.

```note
If for any reason you would like to remove this cert, you can find it in Settings > General > Profile.
```

### Congratulate Yourself!

mitmproxy is now setup!

If you're not running the proxy, your internet will be broken. Go back and reset
your browser/network's proxy settings and turn off the HTTP proxy on your phone
to go back to the good ol' non-mitmproxied internet :)

```note
To turn off the proxy:

* For Safari and Chrome, uncheck the Web Proxy (HTTP) and Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS) checkboxes
* For Firefox, select the No Proxy radio button
* On your iPhone, set Configure Proxy to Off
```

## Part 2

### Break it Down

Let's take a look at the data we're getting in. Fire up mitmproxy and then visit
the site of your choosing: say [www.wired.com](www.wired.com) for example.
Before doing so, let's nuke our browser cookies and history, and then close all
the apps on our phone.

```bash
mitmproxy --showhost
```

![mitmproxy logs](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KgqoacZ0CtXceZ3_wSebVg.jpeg)

Take a look at the second request near the big red arrow. On the first line we
see the client's request, including:

- **[HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):**
  This indicates what type of request the client is making (i.e. GET-ting data
  from a server or POST-ing data to a server)
- **Endpoint:** This is the address for the resource being requested
- **HTTP revision:** 1 being HTTP and 2 being HTTPS

The second line contains the server's response, including:

- **[HTTP response status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status):**
  This indicates if the request was successful or not.
- **[Type of response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3828352/what-is-a-mime-type):**
  Also known as a MIME type, this labels the data as either an HTML document, an
  image, an audio file, a font, etc
- **Size**
- **Response time**

Another thing to note is the number on the bottom. By the time the page loaded,
the client (i.e my browser) made ~100 requests! Keep in mind this includes
requests made by browser extensions and trackers as well.

### Shortcuts!

Before we track down some trackers, I want to give you a few shortcuts.

- **arrow keys:** move the indicator along the list of requests
- **enter:** dives into the request/response details (from here, use the arrow
  keys to navigate between the request, response, and detail screens)
- **esc:** exits a prompt or returns to the list view
- **spacebar:** jumps to the next page of requests
- **w:** saves the request
- **r:** replay the request
- **z:** delete all the requests
- **f:** filter for a type of request. List of commands can be
  [found here](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-filters/)
- **shift + ?:** see a full list of keybindings

### Who's Tracking Who?

Let's find a tracker! Web beacons (A.K.A tracking pixels) are often loaded onto
a webpage as a tiny gif. Let's find one by typing **f** to set a view filter,
then type

```bash
t gif
```

Ugh, I'm showing around 70 results pop up. Mostly from Parse.ly or Wired's
parent company Condé Naste. Gross. Selecting a random request (by pressing
**enter**) doesn't reveal too much… mostly that I'm on a desktop and they're
tracking the time I've been on their site.

How about JSON requests:

```bash
t json
```

Not too many results, but randomly inspecting a request, I can find my exact
location in the response payload… creepy.

![Filtered request logs](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*X6G-Yvv-GZ3Z6APXoGKtOg.jpeg)

Let's take a look at what my phone is puking out. I've opened up the Dictionary
app and here's the results:

![Filtered request logs](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*qSXCPCu1ufAnQ0hy9WvSIw.jpeg)

More than half of the network activity is dedicated to ads. sad. After letting
it sit a while, my background app activity kicks in. Notice the different HTTP
methods: Most are XML related (PROPFIND and PROPPATCH) or are some preflight
requests (OPTIONS).

Welp, that's about it. I'd encourage you to continue poking around and please
let me know if you find anything weird. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You
can use mitmproxy to also modify data streams, which opens the doors to who
knows what.

Thanks!
