The [2024 State of JS](https://2024.stateofjs.com/) came out not too long ago,
so I'm going to dive into some of the things that caught my eye.

## Imports Statements

There are 2 ways of importing a module in JS:
[statically](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
or
[dynamically](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).

```js
// static
import defaultModule from "module";
import { namedModule } from "module";

// dynamic
const dynamicModule = await import("module");
```

Both satisfy the same requirement of moving code from point A to B, but there
are some differences I wasn't totally aware of.

### Execution

As you can tell by the above syntax, unlike static imports, dynamic imports
resolve to a Promise. This ability to **dynamically** import a module, opens up
some interesting use cases, especially if said module is slow, resource
intensive, and/or conditionally important.

I'm guessing this is how [React.lazy](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy)
works, since both share the same signatures.

### Live Bindings

Live bindings are something I've never experienced first-hand, but, honestly, my
first though is that it sets us up for some nasty bugs ðŸ˜³. Static imports return
a [Binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Binding), which is
a JS entity that is reactive. Meaning, it's immutable and read-only because its
source has the ability to update it.

Probably best explained through code, so take this contrived example plucked
from MDN:

```ts
// module.ts
export let value = "first value";
setTimeout(() => (value = "second value"), 500);

// main.ts
import { value } from "./module.ts";

console.log(value); // "first value"
setTimeout(
  () => console.log(value), // "second value"
  1500,
);
```

### Import Attributes

[Import Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with)
are useful when an HTTP's content-type value is set incorrectly. For example, if
fetching a json file, a browser is going to parsed it as JS, which would result
in the following error:

```http no-copy
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server
responded with a MIME type of "application/json". Strict MIME type checking is
enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

The solution, is adding a `{with: {type: "json"}}` obj as the second argument.

```ts
// fails
import("data.json");
// succeeds
import("/data.json", { with: { type: "json" } });
```

## WebSockets

I've always used a library to handle WebSockets, so most of this was obfuscated
from me, but here's what I've learned when trying to roll me own.

### Handshake

A WebSocket is initiated on the client by sending an `UPGRADE` HTTP request
where the browser will set some distinct headers:

```http no-copy
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

The server responds, by generating a `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` value from the
`Sec-WebSocket-Key` header and returns a `101`:

```http no-copy
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
```

I'm not sure why, but there's a very specific formula in generating the `Accept`
header.

1. Concatenate `Key` header with the
   [magical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_string) string:
   `"258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"`
2. Take the SHA-1 hash of step 1
3. Base64 the hash

Bada bing bada boom, a socket is established.

### Data Frames

Establishing a connection is fairly straight forward. The complexity goes
through the roof when extracting information from the messages, which takes the
form of a "frames of data". The general idea is each frame is broken into 4
parts:

Part one contains the `FIN` and `opcode` fields. I see this as metadata for the
data frame. It contains information such as the type of data (i.e., text,
binary, etc.) and if it's multipart (i.e. does this frame contain all the
information or will there be more to come).

Part two contains the payload length. In other words, this informs our reader
when to stop processing the data.

Part three is the "mask". For all client-to-server communication, the data is
[XOR encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher). This mask serves as
the key to decode the payload.

The final part is the payload.

## Astro

I've been sleeping on [Astro](https://astro.build/), but it's f-ing cool. It's
moving the industry in the direction I'm personally a big fan of: more SSR with
more partial renders.

Astro is achieving this partially-hydrate-on-the-client type rendering through
its [island architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/).
Next.js has something similar with
[PPR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering)
but the HTTP implementation differs. Astro sends over a payload to the client,
then, within a JS module, makes another request for the delayed component.
Next.js, on the other hand, creates a long-lived stream that doesn't close until
all the delay components have resolved.

Syntactically, they don't feel too different and I'd argue the DX is comparable:

```tsx
/** ASTRO */

// components/slowComponent.astro
---
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
---

<div>Long awaited content :)</div>

// pages/index.astro
---
import SlowComponent from '@/components/slowComponent.astro'
export const prerender = false
---

<h1>Static Title</h1>

<SlowComponent server:defer>
  <div slot="fallback">Loading...</div>
</SlowComponent>

<p>More static content here</p>
```

```tsx
/** NEXT.JS */

// components/slowComponent.tsx
export default async function SlowComponent() {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));

  <div>Long awaited content :)</div>
}

// app/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import SlowComponent from '@/components/SlowComponent.tsx'

export default async function Home() {
  return (
    <h1>Static Title</h1>

    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <SlowComponent />
    </Suspense>

    <p>More static content here</p>
  );
}
```

## Other Stuff

That's pretty much all I got. There's a couple other features, such as
[Promise.allSettled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled),
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), and Astro + React that I dinked around with in
the [GH repo](https://github.com/blakenetz/state-of-js-2024). Take a look if
you're interested.

As always, thank you for reading and let me know what you think!
