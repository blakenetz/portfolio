# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The Dweb: Using Beaker + Dat to Surf and Publish on the Decentralized Web!

The Internet is beautiful dumpster fire. One of the more profound inventions of
our time, it was designed to liberate and empower the billions of people on
earth by making information readily available. Yet somewhere along the way, the
power has shifted and information is now being funneled through a select few
players before it reaches you and me. The consequences of this design change has
created a negative rippled effect in almost all factors of human life, to the
extent that even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,
[has spoke out against this trend](https://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/).
The decentralized web is predicted to be our saving grace. This article is aimed
to teach you<sup>\*</sup> how to get your foot in the door and surf the next
generation of the Internet.

<sup>\*</sup>Though at some point we might dive into the weeds and get into some
technical concepts, this article is intended for everyone‚Ä¶ just like the
original Internet üòâ

## First, Some History

The Internet was built on the concept of decentralization. Information would be
distributed through a fault-tolerant network of independently-run nodes. If one
node went down or become insecure, the information could be re-routed through a
series of neighboring nodes to reach it‚Äôs final destination. This much has
remained true to today.

When people bellyache that the Internet has become centralized, they‚Äôre either
referring to the fact that the ownership of these nodes has been funneled to a
few major players(i.e. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) or the exclusive access
to these nodes has been limited to a few dominant companies (i.e. your Internet
Service Provider: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.).

This concentration of power has opened the doors to massive censorship, the
widespread dissemination of ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù, and the unwinding of the network‚Äôs
neutrality\*. As for-profit companies strengthen their grip on the Internet,
ours will weaken.

\*If you choose one topic to dive further into, pick net neutrality. In a nut
shell, a non-neutral Internet allows ISPs to prioritize traffic, which means the
website of a higher paying customer (i.e a wealthy corporation) would load
exponentially faster. Considering most users will abandon a page if it doesn‚Äôt
load within a 4-second window, this could be detrimental for companies and
individuals who can‚Äôt afford to bribe the ISPs for a faster loading time. I will
point out that we‚Äôre still in the early days of a post-neutral net, so many of
these dystopic predictions are still years away.

## Decentralize It

It wouldn‚Äôt be an tech article without some TLAs (three-letter acronyms), so
here we go: P2P!

Peer-to-peer is networking strategy that partitions workloads and resources to a
vast network of peers. Our current distribution strategy is structured around
client-server interactions via spoke-hub model. I (the client) request
information from a website (the server), which returns a packet of information
that travels through a series of spoke and hubs (we previously referred to these
as nodes).
