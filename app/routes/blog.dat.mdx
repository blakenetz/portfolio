# 🏄‍♀️ The Dweb: Using Beaker + Dat to Surf and Publish on the Decentralized Web!

The Internet is beautiful dumpster fire. One of the more profound inventions of our time, it was designed to liberate and empower the billions of people on earth by making information readily available. Yet somewhere along the way, the power has shifted and information is now being funneled through a select few players before it reaches you and me. The consequences of this design change has created a negative rippled effect in almost all factors of human life, to the extent that even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has spoke out against this trend. The decentralized web is predicted to be our saving grace. This article is aimed to teach you\* how to get your foot in the door and surf the next generation of the Internet.

\*Though at some point we might dive into the weeds and get into some technical concepts, this article is intended for everyone… just like the original Internet 😉
